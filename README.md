## Overview  
**Thomas UCG Fields** is a falsifiable scalar–tensor cosmological model proposing that a primordial rupture in the early universe left behind anisotropic memory structures.  
The theory introduces:
- `φ(t)`: an entropic smoothing scalar field  
- `R_fossil`: a residual curvature memory tensor  
- `∇^μJ_μ`: a flow divergence field identifying structural scars in the universe  

It is tested against gamma-ray burst (GRB) sky clustering and shows predictive alignment with observed structure in specific redshift bands.

## What This Repository Contains  
- 📄 `Thomas_UCG_FIELDS_FINAL_PATCHED_DOI_AND_GITHUB.docx` – The full manuscript  
- 📄 `Thomas_UCG_FIELDS_FINAL_PATCHED_DOI_AND_GITHUB.pdf` – PDF version of the paper  
- 📁 `/data/` – GRB redshift datasets (`.csv`) used for null simulations and overlays  
- 🧪 `Thomas_UCG_Scar_KDE_Overlay.ipynb` – (Coming soon) Python notebook for scar field visualization and clustering analysis  
- 📷 `/images/` – Vector flow fields, overlay maps, and CEERS predictions

## Pre-Registered Forecasts  
As of May 2025, the model predicts:

1. **Galaxy clustering** in JWST fields (COSMOS-Web Phase 2, PRIMER) at **RA 52°–58°, Dec −5° to +10°** for **z > 8**  
2. **E-mode suppression** at ℓ = 2–4 in CMB polarization maps (LiteBIRD/CMB-S4) aligned with the same RA/Dec zone

These are forward-facing tests of the model’s scar divergence zones.

## Reproducibility  
All statistical analysis and clustering overlays were created using:
- Python 3.x  
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `seaborn`  
- GRB datasets from [GRBOX](http://lyra.berkeley.edu/grbox.php)

A Colab-ready version of the GRB clustering pipeline will be available soon.
